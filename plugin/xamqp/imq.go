// and consume the elements coming on a queue.

// Receiver is a function type that will be called every time
// a message arrives on the message queue. It will be provided
// with a Delivery. The Receiver can then use the Body of the
// Delivery to make the necessary computations and either
// acknowledge or non acknowledge the message for it to be
// requeued or not.
// The boolean channel can make the message queue stop consuming the queue.
// If so, it will be needed to call Consume again, because the function will return.

// Delivery interface provide a wrapper for the message and acknowledgment
// system of AMQP. It will allows the read the body of the message and either
// aknowledge it or non acknowledge it.
