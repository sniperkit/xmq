* TODO Implement influxdb support
** TODO Find a way to divide record fields into influx measurement parts

   Such as:

   - measurement
   - tags
   - fields

   See [[https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.3/introduction/getting_started/][doc]] to get knowledge about what is indexed and what is not.

** TODO How to perform a default timestamp calculation?

   There are two options the user may want:

   - generate timestamp when data is consumed
   - generate timestamp from data

   For our usecase first is ok, but we should make architecture decision
   thinking about both.
