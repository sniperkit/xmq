The mmap file buffer type uses memory mapped files to perform low-latency,
file-persisted buffering of messages.

To configure the mmap file buffer you need to designate a writeable directory
for storing the mapped files. Benthos will create multiple files in this
directory as it fills them.

When files are fully read from they will be deleted. You can disable this
feature if you wish to preserve the data indefinitely, but the directory will
fill up as fast as data passes through.`,
